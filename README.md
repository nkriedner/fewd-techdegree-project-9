This is my "**Capstone Portfolio**" webpage - the final project for **Teamtreehouse's Frontend Web Development Techdegree**.

I had to show all my frontend skills to create my own portfolio page, displaying some of my projects, as well as an "About" and a "Contact" section.

I received an "Exceeds Expectation" grade upon submitting the project.

All the code has been - if not otherwise commented in the code - written by myself.
